# Project 3 - Tic Tac Toe
For this project we built a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. 
WE made use of different elements of Object Oriented programming(OOP) within the game - Class ,Instance variable, and Method.

## How Tic Tac Toe is played?
* Tic Tac Toe is board game played on a board with a 3 squared by 3 squared grid.

* The players are assigned their own symbols to place on the board cells

* Player 1 will be assigned the `X` symbol.

* Player 2 will be assigned the `O` symbol.

* Players take turn to place their symbols on the board.

* The grid is numbered from 1 to 9.

* You place the symbol by choosing the cell number.

* The  First Player to get 3 of her symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.

* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
